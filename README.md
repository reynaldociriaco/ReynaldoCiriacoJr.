About Me
Hi, I'm Reynaldo E. Ciriaco, a BSIT student at New Era University. I know basic coding, but not that well because I'm more focused and I know more about web design, databases, and networking. I enjoy taking on tricky problems and coming up with elegant solutions. I enrolled in the BS in Information Technology program, which marked the beginning of my tech career.
